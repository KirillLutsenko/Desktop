**Second Test Task:** 

- Create an html page containing 14 square div blocks.
- In each block in the center there are numbers from 1 to 14, respectively.
- On a mobile device there should be no more than 3 blocks in a row, on a desktop - 5-6 blocks in a row.
- The size of the blocks should vary depending on the screen resolution, but the block should remain square.
- When you click on a block, a 3-4-point context menu should open to the right of the block.
- If the menu "climbs" off the screen (on the last blocks in the line), the menu should open to the left of the block.
- It is allowed to use bootstrap, jquery, any jquery-libraries.
